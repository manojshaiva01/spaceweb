            <span class="paragraph">The largest objects that orbit the Sun are the eight planets. In order from the Sun, they are four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). All terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. Inversely, all giant planets do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids. Over 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of the remaining mass is in Jupiter and Saturn.

            There is a strong consensus among astronomers. that the Solar System has at least nine dwarf planets: Ceres, Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake, Gonggong, Eris, and Sedna. There are a vast number of small Solar System bodies, such as asteroids, comets, centaurs, meteoroids, and interplanetary dust clouds. Some of these bodies are in the asteroid belt (between Mars's and Jupiter's orbit) and the Kuiper belt (just outside Neptune's orbit). Six planets, seven dwarf planets, and other bodies have orbiting natural satellites, which are commonly called 'moons'.

            The Solar System is constantly flooded by the Sun's charged particles, the solar wind, forming the heliosphere. Around 75–90 astronomical units from the Sun, the solar wind is halted, resulting in the heliopause. This is the boundary of the Solar System to interstellar space. </span>

            1. MercuryMercury is the closest planet to the Sun and also the smallest in the solar system. Because it is so near to the Sun, it experiences extreme temperatures—very hot during the day and freezing cold at night. It has no atmosphere to protect it or trap heat. Mercury moves around the Sun faster than any other planet, which is why it’s named after the Roman messenger god.<hr>
                
                
                2. Venus
                Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is similar in size and structure to Earth. However, it has a thick, toxic atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, which traps heat and makes Venus the hottest planet in the solar system. The surface is rocky and covered with volcanoes. Interestingly, Venus rotates in the opposite direction of most other planets, meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.<hr>
                
                
                3. Earth
                Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only planet known to support life. It has a perfect balance of atmosphere, temperature, and water. About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered with water, making it a "blue planet." Earth has one natural satellite—the Moon—and its atmosphere protects us from harmful space radiation.<hr>
                
                
                4. Mars
                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the "Red Planet" because of its reddish appearance caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It has a cold and thin atmosphere, and scientists believe it may have had liquid water in the past. Mars is home to the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and has been a major target for space missions exploring the possibility of life.<hr>
                
                
                5. Jupiter
                Jupiter is the fifth planet and the largest in the solar system. It is a gas giant made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter is famous for its Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for hundreds of years. It has a strong magnetic field and more than 90 known moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system.<hr>
                
                
                6. Saturn
                Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is best known for its stunning rings made of ice and rock particles. It is also a gas giant like Jupiter and has a very low density—it could float in water if there were a big enough ocean! Saturn has over 80 moons, and its largest moon, Titan, has a thick atmosphere and possibly lakes of liquid methane.<hr>
                
                
                7. Uranus
                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is known for its pale blue color, caused by methane gas in its atmosphere. It’s unique because it rotates on its side, possibly due to a massive collision in the past. Uranus is an ice giant and has a cold, windy atmosphere. It has faint rings and 27 known moons.<hr>

                8. Neptune
                Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun. It is dark, cold, and very windy. Like Uranus, Neptune is an ice giant and has a deep blue color. Its winds are the fastest in the solar system, reaching speeds over 1,500 miles per hour. Neptune also has several moons, with Triton being the largest and most interesting because it orbits the planet backward.</P>
